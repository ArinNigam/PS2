Sitters, or one-to-one observers, are\ncommonly used in inpatient settings to meet monitoring needs of high-risk\npatients. Utilizing AI/ML based video analytics technology such as continuous\nvideo monitoring can relieve sitters to allow for optimal productivity, increased\nsafety, cost reduction, and nurse/family satisfaction. The project involves building\nAI/ML driven video analytics module to monitor patients as well as surveillance\nof people in contact with the patient as well as the surrounding facilities. Once\nan anomaly id identified, the system should push them to the nursing staff.\n\nIntelligent Document Processing\nGlobally about 80-90% of all data is unstructured. Insurance companies have a\nlarge and rapidly growing unstructured data content and many of them do not\nhaving the ability to make use of it to take the right business decisions.\nUnstructured content includes Policy Documents, Claims Documents, Annual\nReports, Emails, Broker Submissions, Knowledge Repositories, paper documents\netc. The Intelligent Document Processing engine executes document\npre-processing using image analytics and readies the document for information\nextraction. The extracted data is them analysed using NLP techniques and\ncorrected for errors, thereby ensuring an extremely high degree of data\nextraction accuracy. The engine checks for inter-field validity and flags values that\noccur with low confidence to call for manual intervention.\nHospital Readmission Prediction\nA hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital,\ngets re-admitted again within a certain period such as 30 days, after the\ndischarge. Hospital readmission prediction involves learning from historical\nmedical data to predict probability of a patient returning to hospital in a certain\nperiod after the discharge. The objective is to help health providers improve\nquality of care, deliver better treatment, lower hospital readmission rate, and\nreduce the medical costs. This project aims to achieve Interpretable &\nExplainable Machine Learning results for the following questions:\nHow accurately can we predict hospital readmission?\nWhat factors are the strongest predictors of hospital readmissions in a certain\ndisease category?\n\n© 2022 HARMAN International | services.harman.com\n\nClaims Analytics\nInsurers rely on rule-based engines which raise alerts for Claims fraud in casualty\ninsurance. A large team triages these alerts and select the candidate claims for\nfurther investigation. There is also the problem of False positives, where only a\nsmall percentage of the of the validated claims turn out to be actual fraudulent\nclaims. Businesses can automate the triaging process with AI model validating\nFraudulent claim alerts using multivariate data. Create features from the\nmultivariate data along with the associated claims description (free text). Robust\nmachine learning algorithms to create models with \u003C0.2% false negatives and\nnone of the actual fraudulent claims being missed.

Make it seamless to work 100% of the time.\nSimplify credential management for cluster deployment and claim. Currently, the AWS credentials need to be manually updated in yaml files and they expire every 8-12 hours with the process needing a repeat again. We need to automate credential management so that the developer is only concerned with working with code and not the infra. Another benefit of this project would be collaborative dev and test where multiple developers can share a setup and push their images.\nMany FIs are generated during NAS restore because of lack of privilege of the configured recovery user. This feature allows the customer admin to run a test backup and recovery workflow. Test run can generate a small data set, back it up, run recovery, do a cleanup and provide a report. Based on the time available, we could improve the test to use each of the Ip address of the source provided which further catches user and configuration errors.\nCurrently windows agents has no traceability and instrumentation support. Helps in improving debuggability and instrumentation of windows agent, plus we can integrate to provide more accurate stats for the agents",

The proposed solution aims to solve this using acoustic monitoring instead - buffaloes are known to “bellow” strongly which can be easily picked up by a microphone and the high frequency nature of acoustic sensors versus an inertial sensor helps better detect the rhythmic low energy nature of rumination. The project will involve developing hardware and firmware for a STM32 based IoT device which can record and edge compute relevant features from acoustic data.\nSkill sets: Familiarity with Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers\nTraits expectation: Fast Learner, Team Player\nExpected learning: A deeper understanding of embedded systems and the product development cycle  \nSpecific courses required for project execution: Digital Design, Microprocessors Programming and Interfacing",

      "Project\n10\nTitle: Structural Characterization of Aggregating and Phase Separated Proteins\nWe are interested in the structural characterization and structural differentiation of amyloids formed by\nthe wt- and the mutant p53 DNA binding domain. p53 is a transcription factor that inhibits genes required\nfor cell cycle progression and activates genes leading to apoptosis. The function of p53 is to prevent the\ncell from becoming cancerous by controlling its cell division. Thus, mutations in p53 can lead to loss of\nfunction and the progress of cancer in about 50% of reported human cancers. The aggregates of p53\nhave been observed in malignant cancers. Cell models have been used to demonstrate the loss of\nfunction and onset of tumors during p53 amyloid formation. p53 is a 393 amino acid long protein with\nthree major domains: N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), core DNA binding domain (DBD)\nand tetramerization domain (TD). Cancers reported with p53 mutations have a higher frequency of\nmutations in the DBD of p53. The outcome of all these mutations is the inability of p53 to bind to its\ntarget DNA sequence. Some of these mutations also show enhanced aggregation tendencies. This\nmutated p53 can seed the in-vivo wt-p53 to form aggregates, a prion-like property. The project involves\nmainly use of magic angle spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and possibly solution-state\nNMR, combined with other structural and biophysics techniques to characterize the structure of p53\namyloids. Further proton detected solid-state NMR methods development may become part of the\nproject depending on the candidate’s interest.\nSkill sets: Principles of Biophysics and biochemistry, protein expression and purification, passion for\nsolving puzzles.\nTraits expectation: ability to work, analyze data and solve problems with focus on understanding and\ndesire for details.\nExpected learning: p53 protein handling and biophysics, overexpression and purification of protein, NMR\nspectroscopy for structural characterization of amyloid, NMR data analysis.\n\nSpecific courses required for project execution: Basic Mathematics, understanding of amino acids and\nProtein science, ability to work on computer.",
