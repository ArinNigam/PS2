Make it seamless to work 100% of the time.\nSimplify credential management for cluster deployment and claim. Currently, the AWS credentials need to be manually updated in yaml files and they expire every 8-12 hours with the process needing a repeat again. We need to automate credential management so that the developer is only concerned with working with code and not the infra. Another benefit of this project would be collaborative dev and test where multiple developers can share a setup and push their images.\nMany FIs are generated during NAS restore because of lack of privilege of the configured recovery user. This feature allows the customer admin to run a test backup and recovery workflow. Test run can generate a small data set, back it up, run recovery, do a cleanup and provide a report. Based on the time available, we could improve the test to use each of the Ip address of the source provided which further catches user and configuration errors.\nCurrently windows agents has no traceability and instrumentation support. Helps in improving debuggability and instrumentation of windows agent, plus we can integrate to provide more accurate stats for the agents",

The proposed solution aims to solve this using acoustic monitoring instead - buffaloes are known to “bellow” strongly which can be easily picked up by a microphone and the high frequency nature of acoustic sensors versus an inertial sensor helps better detect the rhythmic low energy nature of rumination.

However, investigation of these processes in the earliest phase, although\ncritically important, is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop single molecule sensitive techniques\nthat can help visualize and characterize these events. We are working to develop microscopy and\nspectroscopy techniques to characterize the liquid liquid phase separation of proteins such as tau protein\nthat are involved in the pathology of diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.\nSkill sets: knowledge of physics, coding, electronics, engineering\nTraits expectation: interest in building techniques, coding and data analysis\nExpected learning: experience with developing state of the art methodologies in biophysical experiments\nSpecific courses required for project execution: physics and/or engineering courses\n\nProject 8 Title: Determinants of Mammalian origin of replication selection\nDescription: In eukaryotes, replication initiation is determined by two temporally decoupled sequential\nsteps; replication origin licensing and firing. During origin licensing, it is estimated that many thousands\nof sites are bound by inactive replicative helicases in each human cell. However, no discernible\nsequence or proteomic profile has been conclusively attributed to origin sites in mammalian cells.\nInfluence of DNA structure and epigenetic context on the origin selection and replication timing will be\nexplored.\nSkill sets: Understanding of DNA and protein structure and interactions.\nTraits expectation: Interested in DNA replication and repair.\nExpected learning: Cell culture, DNA fibre, flow cytometry, genome editing.\nSpecific courses required for project execution: Biochemistry, Molecular biology",

      "Project\n10\nTitle: Structural Characterization of Aggregating and Phase Separated Proteins\nWe are interested in the structural characterization and structural differentiation of amyloids formed by\nthe wt- and the mutant p53 DNA binding domain. p53 is a transcription factor that inhibits genes required\nfor cell cycle progression and activates genes leading to apoptosis. The function of p53 is to prevent the\ncell from becoming cancerous by controlling its cell division. Thus, mutations in p53 can lead to loss of\nfunction and the progress of cancer in about 50% of reported human cancers. The aggregates of p53\nhave been observed in malignant cancers. Cell models have been used to demonstrate the loss of\nfunction and onset of tumors during p53 amyloid formation. p53 is a 393 amino acid long protein with\nthree major domains: N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD), core DNA binding domain (DBD)\nand tetramerization domain (TD). Cancers reported with p53 mutations have a higher frequency of\nmutations in the DBD of p53. The outcome of all these mutations is the inability of p53 to bind to its\ntarget DNA sequence. Some of these mutations also show enhanced aggregation tendencies. This\nmutated p53 can seed the in-vivo wt-p53 to form aggregates, a prion-like property. The project involves\nmainly use of magic angle spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and possibly solution-state\nNMR, combined with other structural and biophysics techniques to characterize the structure of p53\namyloids. Further proton detected solid-state NMR methods development may become part of the\nproject depending on the candidate’s interest.\nSkill sets: Principles of Biophysics and biochemistry, protein expression and purification, passion for\nsolving puzzles.\nTraits expectation: ability to work, analyze data and solve problems with focus on understanding and\ndesire for details.\nExpected learning: p53 protein handling and biophysics, overexpression and purification of protein, NMR\nspectroscopy for structural characterization of amyloid, NMR data analysis.\n\nSpecific courses required for project execution: Basic Mathematics, understanding of amino acids and\nProtein science, ability to work on computer.",

      "Role of the Interning Student:\nGFGC is poised to transform the Indian lending industry with an innovative, unified lending services platform. The group is rapidly scaling its operations and, within less than a year, has already formed partnerships with over 40 financial institutions, established a presence in 15 states, and grown its team to over 250 employees. Additionally, GFGC is collaborating with Deloitte to develop a cutting-edge technology platform.\nThe candidate will work closely with the Senior Management, playing a key role in shaping and executing business and operational strategies across the group’s various verticals and functions. The position involves conducting thorough research on leading consulting and financial services firms, creating strategic business plans to strengthen GFGC's market position, and collaborating with internal and external stakeholders to implement organization-wide initiatives. The projects will include benchmarking against leading consulting and top service/quick commerce firms, developing and implementing strategies to not only meet but surpass those standards, driving business expansion, and supporting key management decisions that impact the entire organization.\n\nAbout the organization:\nFormed in 2023, Greenfinch Global Consulting is a pan India Financial Services group founded by an Industry veteran and based out of Jaipur. We provide services to Financial Institutions such as Banks, NBFCs, HFCs related to their loan processing journey. These services include property valuation, legal search and verification, credit FI and collection services.\nThe firm has been founded by Mr. Sushil Kumar Agarwal, Founder and ex-CEO of Aavas Financiers Ltd., a ~15000 Cr public listed housing finance company. After exiting Aavas in 2023, Mr. Sushil formed Greenfinch Global Consulting (GFGC), which solves the critical pain points faced by the financial institutions for their expansion. Typically, for valuation, legal search or other services, the financial institutions need to partner with local vendor at each of their branch location. This results in low or no standardization of service, maintenance overhead for a large number of vendors and limitation to quick scalability.\nGFGC provides centrally managed service partnership for Financial Institutions eliminating the need of identifying, onboarding and managing a new and separate partner for each service at each branch, along with providing a standardized and reliable quality service.\n\nStructure of the Company: The company has for 4 verticals – Property Valuation, Legal Verification, Credit Verification and Collections – under a group company. \nThe senior management of the company has unmatched experience in the financial services domain with proven execution expertise.\nMr. Abhishek Tiwari, CEO at GFGC, has 24+ years’ experience in retail lending & insurance distribution.
